# GM(1,1) Grey Model Project
This Python project is an implementation of the GM(1,1) grey prediction model. It is a data-driven, time-series forecasting method commonly used in systems with incomplete information or poor information.

## Prerequisites
The project requires Python 3 and the following Python libraries installed:

- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Files
`gray_model.py` : The main Python script that runs the GM(1,1) model.

## Usage
You can run the Python script from the command line (make sure you're in the directory where `grey_model.py` is located):
```bash
python grey_model.py
```

## Example
A sample dataset is used to demonstrate the prediction performance of the GM(1,1) model. It is based on the data provided in the paper `DOI:10.4236/gep.2017.59011`.
